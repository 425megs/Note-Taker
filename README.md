==============================================

The following HTML routes should be created:

* `GET *` should return the `index.html` file.

* `POST /api/notes` should receive a new note to save on the request body, add it to the `db.json` file, and then return the new note to the client. You'll need to find a way to give each note a unique id when it's saved (look into npm packages that could do this for you).

  * Application back end must store notes that have a unique id in a JSON file.
