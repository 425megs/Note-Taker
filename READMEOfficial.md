# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

The following HTML routes should be created:

* `GET *` should return the `index.html` file.

* `POST /api/notes` should receive a new note to save on the request body, add it to the `db.json` file, and then return the new note to the client. You'll need to find a way to give each note a unique id when it's saved (look into npm packages that could do this for you).

  * Application back end must store notes that have a unique id in a JSON file.

  * Application must be deployed to Heroku.


### Deployment: 36%

* Application deployed at live URL.

* Application loads with no errors.

* Application GitHub URL submitted.

* GitHub repository contains application code.

You are required to submit BOTH of the following for review:

* The URL of the functional, deployed application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a README describing the project.
